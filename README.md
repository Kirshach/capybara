## About

This one started as a result of my personal dissatisfaction with existing browser bookmark organizers extensions.

Beginning as a web app developed by me and two of my colleagues, it is currently being refactored and re-written as a Chrome browser extension.

Highly customizable, with touch-platform-like friendly interface and supposedly supporting multiple-level folders (not quite there yet), it is what I lack in browsers' new tab pages.

The app currently supports basic browser integration such as:
- the ability to import bookmarks from the browser
- synchronization between app tiles content and browser bookmarks

## TODOs: 
- [ ] Interactive folder support
- [ ] Immediate synchronization between multiple open application tabs
- [ ] Screen width adaptivity
- [ ] Global styles customization
- [ ] Advanced single tile styling options

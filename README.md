 ~~About~~

~~This one started as a result of my personal dissatisfaction with existing browser bookmark organizers extensions.~~

~~Beginning as a web app developed by me and two of my colleagues, it is currently being refactored and re-written as a Chrome browser extension.~~

~~Highly customizable, with touch-platform-like friendly interface and supposedly supporting multiple-level folders (not quite there yet), it is what I lack in browsers' new tab pages.~~

~~[Capybara demo](https://youtu.be/0RdaOPMI_BA)~~

~~The app currently supports basic browser integration such as:~~
~~- the ability to import bookmarks from the browser~~
~~- synchronization between app tiles content and browser bookmarks~~

### The project is abandonded for the better days in favour of [Glacier](https://github.com/Kirshach/Glacier)
